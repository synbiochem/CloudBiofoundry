## Steps

1. Biosynthetic pathway from chassis to target computed through **RetroPath** (retrosynthesis).
1. Enzyme sequences selected for each reaction step through **Selenzyme**.
1. Assign kinetic constants ranges to each sequence.
1. Specify experimental parameters.
1. Generate experimental design.
1. For each construct, generate SBML dynamic model of the pathway.
1. Simulate pathways through ensemble modeling.
